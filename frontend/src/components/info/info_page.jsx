//       <p>When we talk about extreme poverty or world hunger, we’re also talking about global thirst. The many ways that water affects our lives are also linked to the causes and effects of poverty — and breaking it. Less than 1% of the world’s water supply is usable for us as humans (the rest is saltwater, in the form of ice, or underground). And of that 1%, we have to share it between 7.7 billion people around the globe. This leaves 844 million people without access to clean water and 2.3 billion people without access to basic sanitation services. This sets people up for a cycle of global thirst that feeds into the cycle of poverty.</p>
